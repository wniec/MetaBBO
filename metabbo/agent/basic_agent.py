"""
This is a basic agent class for MetaBBO agents. All agents should inherit from this class.
Your own agent should have the following methods:
    1. __init__(self, config) : to initialize the agent
    2. train_episode(self, env, epoch_id, logger) : to train the agent for an episode by using env.reset() and
       env.step() to interact with environment. It's expected to return a Tuple[bool, dict] whose first element
       indicates whether the learned step has exceeded the max_learning_step and second element is a dictionary
       that contains:
       { 'normalizer' : the best cost in initial population.
         'gbest' : the best cost found in this episode.
         'return' : total reward in this episode.
         'learn_steps' : the number of accumulated learned steps of the agent.
       }
    3. rollout_episode(self, env, epoch_id, logger) : to rollout the agent for an episode by using env.reset() and
       env.step() to interact with environment. It's expected to return a dictionary that contains:
       { 'cost' : a list of costs that need to be maintained in backbone optimizer. See learnable_optimizer.py for more details.
         'fes' : times of function evaluations used by optimizer.
         'return' : total reward in this episode.
       }
